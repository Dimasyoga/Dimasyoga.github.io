Hi everyone !!!

So I am finally got to write my first blog post :satisfied:. Just so you know, I want to write a blog since 2 or 3 years ago, but because I am a very busy person I ended up putting off that plan and doing something else (well, not really busy, just bad time management). Now after I am done with my college life and my thesis project, I have a lot of free time which makes me stressed because I don't know what to do and this coronavirus pandemic still hasn't disappeared. So I thought continuing with my plans for blogging would be the perfect activity for now.

What I enjoy about creating a personal blog is not the writing part, but the process of building a website: what to use, what are the pros and cons of using this or that, where to deploy, etc. I ended up spending most of my time reading documentation about [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a static site generator I used for this website) such as how to configure it, what else it can do, and much more. Yes, I think I'm the typical tech geek who is always asked to fix computers or hack Facebook accounts. But I think my intention to write a blog at first was as a means for me to practice my writing skills, so I had to start thinking about what content I should write to fill my personal blog.

At this point, I'm still not sure what I want to fill my personal blog with. Because the name is a personal blog, that means it's up to me as to whatever content I'm going to put in, right?. Don't mind that, I just wanted to make this the perfect super cool personal blog, but I'm not sure what to do. Most of the blog I read are tutorials to use some framework/software or blogs on how to play games, so I don't have many references. So whatever, maybe for now I will practice [freewriting techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_writing) while writing because I think it will help beginners like me to immediately write, write what's on your mind and don't think too much about the content.

Thanks to anyone who reads my blog, I'm really curious how you guys found this blog but hope you enjoy it.
