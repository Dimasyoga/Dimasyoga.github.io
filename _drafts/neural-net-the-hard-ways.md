## Intro

I am implement a simple backpropagation algorithm with gradient descend to optimizing 4 layer artificial neural networks.

## Purpose

I want to understand the learning process of artificial neural network with doing a hand on programming.

## Method

I am using C++ programming language and armadillo library to compute matrix data. The neural network weight of each layer is represented by matrix m x n, where m is number of front neuron and n is number of back neuron.

## Process

Setting environment.
Build neural network.
Create feedforward algorithm.
Formulate the gradient descend equation for backpropagation.
Testing.

## Conclusion

The backpropagation algorithm managed to make the output of neural network match with desired output.
